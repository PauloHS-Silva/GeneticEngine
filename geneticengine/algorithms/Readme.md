Algorithms
==========

Genetic Engine currently supports the following algorithms, all following the [Heuristics](heuristics.py) protocol:
* [Genetic Programming](gp/)
* [Hill Climbing](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/papers/pdf/02.encycl-hillclimbing.pdf)
* Random search
* Random Mutations

Along algorithms, we introduced the [Problem](../core/problems.py) class. There are two possible problem types, single-objective problems and multiple-objectives problems.
