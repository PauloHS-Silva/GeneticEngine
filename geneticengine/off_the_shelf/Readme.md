Off-the-shelf methods
=====================

Genetic Engine supports off-the-shelf, sk-learn-style [classifiers](classifiers.py) and [regressors](regressors.py). Currently, we support Genetic Programming and Hill Climbing.

[Look here for an example of how to use these methods.](../../examples/sklearn-type-examples.py)
