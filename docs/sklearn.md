# Sklearn-compatible API

Genetic Engine supports off-the-shelf, sklearn-style [classifiers](../examples/classifiers.py) and [regressors](../examples/regressors.py). Currently, we support Genetic Programming and Hill Climbing.

[Look here for an example of how to use these methods.](../examples/sklearn-type-examples.py)
